ClueWords is a board game for 4-8 players. Two teams compete by having a spymaster give one word clue that can point to multiple words on the board. The other players on the team attempt to guess their teamâ€™s words while avoiding the words of the other team.
This application is built using Node.js, Express.js, React.js, Socket.io, MongoDB and AWS.
